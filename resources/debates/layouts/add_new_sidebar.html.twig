<ul class="recommendations">
    <li>
        <i class="bi bi-check-square-fill"></i>
        Do not use capital letters for the debate title or for whole sentences. On the internet, 
        this is considered shouting. And nobody likes being shouted at.
    </li>
      
    <li>
        <i class="bi bi-check-square-fill"></i>
        Any debate or comment suggesting illegal action will be deleted, as well as those intending to
         sabotage the debate spaces. Anything else is allowed.
    </li>

    <li>
        <i class="bi bi-check-square-fill"></i>
        Ruthless criticism is very welcome. This is a space for reflection. But we recommend that you stick 
        to elegance and intelligence. The world is a better place with these virtues in it.
    </li>

    <li>
        <i class="bi bi-check-square-fill"></i>
        Enjoy this space and the voices that fill it. It belongs to you too.
    </li>
