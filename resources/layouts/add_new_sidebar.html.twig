        <h2>Recommendations for creating a debate</h2>

<ul class="recommendations">
    <li>
        <span class="fa fa-check-square"></span> 
        Do not use capital letters for the debate title or for whole sentences. On the internet, 
        this is considered shouting. And nobody likes being shouted at.
    </li>
      
    <li>
        <span class="fa fa-check-square"></span>
        Any debate or comment suggesting illegal action will be deleted, as well as those intending to
         sabotage the debate spaces. Anything else is allowed.

        Ruthless criticism is very welcome. This is a space for reflection. But we recommend that you stick 
        to elegance and intelligence. The world is a better place with these virtues in it.

        Enjoy this space and the voices that fill it. It belongs to you too.
