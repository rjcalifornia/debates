# DEBATES

Citizen Participation and Open Government plugin. Inspired by the CONSUL Project: https://consulproject.org/en/

## Main Features

This plugin provides a place where anyone can open threads on any subject, creating separate spaces where people can discuss the proposed topic. Debates are valued by everybody, to highlight the most important issues.

The debates module makes it easier for citizens to make visible the issues that seem important to them, and for them to meet each other to debate or collaborate on these issues.  It is a space for listening, but also for citizen gathering. 
Users  can  vote  for  or  against  the  debates,  so  that  the  most  highly  valued  debates  are 
those that are regularly displayed on the main debates page.
